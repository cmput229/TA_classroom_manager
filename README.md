# Classroom Manager
A repo to hold all the tools being developed.

This set of tools can be used to:  
- Distribute assignment starter code to students as private repos belonging to a GitHub organization.
- Provide continuous integration to students with Travis running spim.
- Provide continuous integration to students with Jenkins. (*TODO*)
- Collect repositories up to a deadline for each assignment.
- Compare student source code using Stanford's Moss.
- Gather local copies of Moss's feedback.
- Automate grading of assignments using a modified version of Owen Stenson's spimgrader.
- Collate results for the class's assignments as .csv files.

## For further help with the service, please refer to the [wiki](https://github.com/cmput229/TA_classroom_manager/wiki).
