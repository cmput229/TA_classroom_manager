To grade all students solutions at once with a single "push button" simply place all of the student solutions in some directory and run:

   ./gradeAllTestsForAllStudents.sh DIRECTORY_WITH_STUDENTS_SOLUTIONS

To grade a single student solution over all test cases, use:

   ./gradeAllTests.sh <student solution file>

To generate the expected output for all tests in the tests directory, (using the solution):

   ./buildExpectedOutput.sh


Guide to the test directory:

Output files that are named as *.outpath are the expected output of the execution path that the program takes while doing its liveness analysis.

Output files that are named as *.out are the expected output of the liveness analysis (the live registers).


Timeouts are currently set to 1s and are set in the runTest script. This can be changed at a later date if need be.
