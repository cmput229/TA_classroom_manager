#TESTCASE GENERATION
################################
Generated tests should go in the tests directory. The tests folder should be located in the same directory as your solution.

1. Write your program into a .s file in "bare" MIPS assembly with the following restrictions:
   - This program should not contain any pseudo instruction (a good way to obtain such a program is to cut and paste the assembly of you MIPS code as displayed by XSPIM). 

2. Run the following command to generate a .bin file (assuming that your .s file is called "example.s":

   expect assemble.exp example.s example.bin | sed '1,7d' | sed '2d'


   - To generate the .bin for several tests (these should be in the directory tests) you can execute the script

   ./compileTests.sh

#RUNNING YOUR SUBMISSION

To generate the output for a single test:

   ./runTest.sh YOURLABFILE TESTFILE

To generate the output for all tests in the tests directory:

   ./runAllTests.sh YOURLABFILE

Timeouts are currently set to 1s and are set in the runTest script. This can be changed at a later date if need be.
